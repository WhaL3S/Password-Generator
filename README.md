# Password Generator 

This is an app created to generate a password. It is written by the use of React. I guess there is no need to explain how to create React app, since all necessary for it information can be found on their official website. Nevertheless, the creation of React app looks amazing, its initialization is incredible. This app is created in order to get acquainted with this library and JSX. Basically, the main code is pretty simple, so it can be useful for beginners. Personally, I learned a lot regaring the creation of the React app itself and using JSX instead of HTML inside of the Javascript. It was really something new for me. Furthermore, I used so called hook to simplify coding since the original version of code is kind of annoying with a lot of self pointing. Also, I used external package react-toastify for some notifications. It really looks cool, so it will be a great addition for future projects. Generally, I recommend to try to recreate this app and learn more about React.js.
